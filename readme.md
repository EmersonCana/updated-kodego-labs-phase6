## Task

1. **Routes Registration**

   - Open your Laravel project in your preferred code editor.
   - Navigate to the `routes` directory and open the `web.php` file.
   - Register at least three routes using the `Route::get()` method:
     - One route should point to a view or controller method to display a welcome message.
     - One route should point to a view or controller method to display a contact form.
     - One route should point to a view or controller method to display a list of products.

2. **Routing Parameters and Dynamic Routes**
   - Register a dynamic route that accepts a parameter for a user's ID.
   - Define a route that points to a controller method to display information about the user with the given ID.
   - Test the dynamic route by visiting the URL with different user IDs and verifying that the correct user information is displayed.

## Task Details

- Implement each task in the `web.php` routes file.
- Test each route to ensure it functions as expected.
- You can use dummy data or mock views/controllers for testing.

## Submission

- After completing the exercise, submit your modified `web.php` routes file.
- Provide comments or documentation within your code to explain the purpose of each route.
