## Objective

The objective of this exercise is to gain practical experience with authentication in Laravel, covering cookies and sessions, authenticating users, authorizing requests, and implementing password protection.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of PHP and Laravel framework.
- Familiarity with web authentication concepts.

## Task

1. **Cookies and Sessions**

   - Understand the role of cookies and sessions in web authentication.
   - Research Laravel's built-in support for managing cookies and sessions.

2. **Authenticating Users**
